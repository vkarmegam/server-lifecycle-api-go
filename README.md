# server-lifecycle-api-go
This project implements a backend service in Go that simulates the lifecycle of virtual servers, including provisioning, state transitions (start, stop, reboot, terminate), billing, logging, and observability. It provides a robust HTTP API to manage these virtual server instances without managing real infrastructure.
